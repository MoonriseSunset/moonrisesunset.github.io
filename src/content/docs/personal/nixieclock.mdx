The 2019 Bay Area Maker Faire was my first exposure to <a target="_base" href="https://makerfaire.com/maker/entry/69348/">nixie clocks</a>.
After this point, I found the orange glow and unique way of displaying numbers to be interesting enough that I wanted to make one myself.

This page serves as a breakdown of the past iteration in addition to being a place for me to document progress on the next iteration.

## 1st Iteration:

### General Overview:

This first iteration had no prior designing, other than reading over the respective part datasheets and generally laying out the whole circuit on a protoboard.
All code in this iteration was done using Arduino IDE on an Arduino Nano Every microcontroller. 

### Sub-modules:

The way this first iteration worked revolved around the Arduino parsing an I2C signal from the DS3231 RTC, and converting it into a serial signal. This serial line was then converted into BCD using the SN74LV8153N.

Finally, I used a combination of the CD4028BE (which controlled the transistors based on the BCD signal) and the MPSA42 transistors (for high voltage switching) to drive the nixie tubes using the BCD signal.

## 2nd Iteration (Planned):

#### Objectives:

- Get assembly made into a PCB
- (as an addendum to the above), familiarize myself with KiCad
- Condense design to use less components
