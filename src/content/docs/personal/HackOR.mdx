Over the COVID pandemic, I contributed to the *Flowr* entry to the HackOR 2021 Hackathon with three other friends.

The goal was to create a web app which would display the status of a pot's soil. This would be achieved through the use of a *Particle Photon* and webhooks to send sensor data to the website which would update accordingly.

By the end of the hackathon, I had the hardware set up and capable of sending sensor data for a webhook to implement.
