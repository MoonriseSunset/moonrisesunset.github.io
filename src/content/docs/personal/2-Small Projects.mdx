These projects are small enough that it would be more efficient for me to just have one page covering multiple, instead of superfluous pages with barely any text in them.

## Niagara
#### A CSS Template for Making Decent-Looking Sites

<LinkCard title="Github Repo" target="_blank" href="" description="Repository currently being cleaned up, check later!"/>

While in middle and high school, I made my first two websites, both being assignments for the odd engineering/computer science course. What united both of these proto-sites was their *horrific* formatting and color choices. 

Back then, I was still learning how CSS, the language used for controlling your site's colors, spacing, and fonts, so when it came time to put colors on my site, I would just chuck random colors in and saw what stuck.

Niagara is my attempt at standardizing a set of layouts and colors which I can then drop in as a sort of set-and-forget piece of code which I know will make my prototype of a site look decent.

## Hephaestus
#### A Discord Bot Framework

**Hephaestus** is a small discord bot framework that I made in Python while developing small discord bots for my high school's robotics club. 

**Note:** I have not maintained Hephaestus since Discord published a new TOS which tightens regulations on discord bots, so I take no responsibility for those who use it in means that break said TOS.
