Over the summer I wanted to explore and mess around with a few languages, so when a friend asked me to help with making a translation suite between strings/chars/numbers to a modified trinary system, I found the perfect project to do so.

The three projects below are roughly the same thing but are written in Python, Dart, and Go respectively. Due to limitations and timing, some of the projects have more limited functionality than others.

## Marionette (Python)
