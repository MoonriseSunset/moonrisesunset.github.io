import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

# Imports:

```python
#from Conversions, which would be in the same directory
import Conversions as conv

#or as a default library
import random as rand

#or as a PIP imported library
import tensorflow as tf
```

# Variables:

Case-sensitive, and type can be changed

---
### Main Types:

Just the general types of variables.

#### Integer (int):
Whole number, that's it
```python
number = 1 
```

#### Float (float):
Number, now with decimals
```python
pi = 3.14
fraction = 0.3333
```

#### Strings/chars (str):
Chars are single letters
```python
Letter = 'A'
```

<Aside>Chars aren't technically their own data type in python, but they have a method for converting to/between unicode. </Aside>

Strings, literally multiple characters, and/or spaces
```python
Sentence = 'The time is: '
```
