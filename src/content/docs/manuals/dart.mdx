import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

In Dart, code is run in a main function, so the general structure of a dart file is:

```dart
//Imports and other stuff out here

void main(){
	//Main Code goes here

}
```

# Dart CLI Shortcuts:

<Aside title="Path"> Make sure to cd into the correct path before using the commands.</Aside>

```
dart create -t console-simple AppNameHere
```

creates a simple project within the named project folder.

---

```
dart run
```

To run the file.

---

```
dart fix --apply
```

To attempt to fix issues in the code (e.g. variables not being constants/finals)

---

```
dart format FileNameHere.dart
```

Condenses/reformats dart code.

---

```
dart compile exe|js FileNameHere.dart
```

Compiles to aforementioned file type (there are more but these are the ones I'll probably use).

# Imports:

## Importing a separate file:

Use file name (with *.dart* suffix and subpath if applicable*) in a string

```dart
import 'some_file.dart';

import 'lib/library.dart';
```

## Importing a default library:

Use *dart:* prefix and then the package/library.

```dart
import 'dart:math';
```

## Importing a <a target="_blank" href="https://pub.dev">pub package (dart library)</a>

Follow instructions in the *Installing* tab of the library.

# Comments and Print:

## Comments:

Similar to C++:
```dart
// single line comment

/*
Multi-line comment
*/

```

## Print Statements:

```dart
print('Hello, World!');
```

To print variables, include a *$* before the variable, or *${}* for longer snippets of code:
```dart
String name = 'John';

print('Hi my name is $name.');
print('Math: ${1 + 10}');

```

# Control Flow:

## Conditionals:
```dart

String color = 'blue';

if (color == 'red'){
	//
} else if (color == 'green'){
	//
} else{
	print('Color is blue!');
}

//Switch/Case statements: 
switch (color){
	case 'red':
		//
	case 'green':
		//
	case 'blue':
		//
	default:
		print('what the heck is this color?');

}

//Single line if statement:
if (color == 'green') print('This is green!');

//Assertion, stops code if the boolean is false, good for dev:
assert(color == 'blue');

```

## Loops:
```dart
//for loop:
for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++){
	print(i);
}

//while loop:
int j = 0;
int answer = 0;
while (j < 20){
	answer = 10 - j;
	print(answer);

	//Break/continue
	if(answer == 0){
		//continue;
		break;
	}
}

//do/while loop:
int k = 0;
do{
	print(k);
} while(k<100);

```
