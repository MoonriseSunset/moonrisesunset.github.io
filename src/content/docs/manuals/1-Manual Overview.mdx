My thought process with this section was to dedicate a section of my portfolio to be a virtual "library" that I could reference later on, and could maybe help others. It's a combination of stuff I learned by myself along with from university classes.

<Aside>The manuals for Dart, HTML, and Python are directly pulled from an old Obsidian vault and presented in a mostly unedited state. Any edits will be to improve formatting on the site.</Aside>

If I have made mistakes in my manuals, please let me know through making a new github issues on this site's <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/MoonriseSunset/moonrisesunset.github.io">github repository</a>.
