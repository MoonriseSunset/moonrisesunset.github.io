I've participated in FIRST Tech Challange Robotics for *5 years*, from 8-12th grade. I've attempted to document all I can below from those years :)

## #10809 Crow Force

For my final year in robotics, I broke with the usual standard of people sticking to one "branch" of a team. More specifically, instead of focusing on just hardware design or outreach, I contributed to:

### Software

During the season, I was interested in making decent looking CSS sites, and as such saw an opportunity to make a simple site for the team.

Using my existing [stylesheet template](../../personal/2-small-projects#niagara), I created a framework that both my teammates and mentors could add onto.

### Hardware

Over the summer leading up to the season, I threw together a rough chassis design so that once the season properly started, we could focus on more important things like scoring systems.

Throughout the season, I was designing secondary 3D-printed parts, such as a battery holder, dual-sided markers, and electrically insulating sideplates.

Towards the end of the season, I performed most of the render's for our team's portfolio, mainly rending photos of the robot itself.

## #8097 Botcats

### 2022-23 Season

As Design Lead for this season, I was focused on managing our CAD to robot pipeline, which included ensuring our Autodesk Fusion drive was running smoothly and contained CAD files for the hardware we had on-hand. Carrying on from the 2021-22 season, I also 3D printed our robot's custom parts.

### 2021-22 Season

During this season, I had a broader role as Hardware Lead. In addition to the responsibilities above, I also managed division of labor across hardware members, kept tabs on part inventory, and ensured we had strong communication of requirements and progress with the Software branch.

### 2020-21 Season

Since this season was during the pandemic, my contributions were focused on contributing CAD iterations towards the robot design along with 3D printing smaller components for the physical robot.

## #16105 Darkness Rising

As a rookie hardware member on Darkness Rising, I learned how to use CAD software, mainly Tinkercad and a little Solidworks, and build FTC robots, something I wasn't used to coming from LEGO robotics.
