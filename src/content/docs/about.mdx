## About Me (copied from <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/MoonriseSunset/MoonriseSunset">About Me Repo</a>)

I'm Moonrise,

I enjoy coding and working on 3D design and printing. Usually I work on small personal projects, though I have participated in school clubs where I utilized these skills. For my more informal site, which has more of my interests/hobbies, check out [my virtual house](../home).

## About the Site

This is the *3rd* major iteration of my website. Lemme break down how this site is set up:

## Site Breakdown

This site is hosted within a <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/MoonriseSunset/moonrisesunset.github.io">single github repository</a> and is built using **Starlight**, an *Astro* template. The color palette is primarily based off of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nordtheme.com">Nord</a>, with some extra colors mixed in.

I used *VSCode* to write the more code heavy sections of this site along with managing source control and npm packages, and *Obsidian* for writing the more text heavy parts.

My personal site is hosted in a separate github repo but is served as a subpage within this site. This allows me to maintain completely separate stylesheets and configurations for each site.
## History

### 2nd Iteration

This fleeting iteration was the first step in transitioning the site from simple HTML and CSS files to a proper JavaScript Framework. In this case, I was testing out migrating the site to a *SvelteKit* project. However, I found the file routing and layout of the project itself to be very unintuitive and somewhat bloated, so I started looking for other frameworks, and stumbled upon this one.

### 1st Iteration

The first iteration of this site was super simple, just around 5 files, 3 HTML files and 2 CSS files sitting in the root of a github pages repository. I made this iteration of the site in high school while learning how to use an external CSS stylesheet. This old version of the site used a modified form of [Niagara](../../../personal/2-small-projects#niagara), a template I made to just chuck in projects to make them look decent.
