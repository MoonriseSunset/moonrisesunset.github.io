import { Badge, Tabs, TabItem, LinkCard, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

As I work on entries here I assign a badge based a badge system to indicate the "readiness" of different pages:

<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="Ongoing"><Badge text="Ongoing" variant="tip" />Similar to the Complete tags, these entries are generally complete descriptions, just for an ongoing project.</TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Beta"><Badge text="Beta" variant="success" />Entries with a Beta tag are generally WIP, with some content filled out.</TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Alpha"><Badge text="Alpha" variant="caution" />Entries with this tag are just bare bones, one step above no content at all.</TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Empty"><Badge text="Empty" variant="danger" />Empty pages which will be worked on later on.</TabItem>
</Tabs>

If an entry doesn't have a label, then it is more or less complete.
